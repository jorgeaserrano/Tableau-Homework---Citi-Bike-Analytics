# Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analytics

## Data Source
Monthly CSV files were collected from the CitiBike System Data: https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data

I encountered many issues working with Tableau Public as the program would breakdown and crash every time I tried to group more than two records or csv files. Therefore, I alalyzed the very first month of the Citibike Program in 2013.

## Analysis

1. Number of Records

The monthly data included over 500 million records. During the very first month of the program, riders seem to gravitate to two days in particular: The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and the 21st. I imagine it was because the program was new and rides were still trying to figure out how the system work. From the first day to the second, there were over 10K riders that took to giving the Citibike program a try. The lowest number of records, it was on the 25th with 3,260 bike riders. Incidently, the 25th was a Thursday.

Peak hours included 7:00 and 17:00-18:00) as rides were either getting to work and off of work. There seems to be a constant set of riders during the day from 8:00 - 16:00).

During the first month of operation, the data indicates that bike riders between the ages of 30 - 40 years of age had the most bike rides and the lowest 80-100 years of age.
